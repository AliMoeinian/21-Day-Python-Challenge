## 📖 About the Book
This book is the result of a personal challenge: to summarize, simplify, and share essential Python concepts in a **21-day learning plan**.  
Each day includes:
- A short and clear explanation of the topic
- Examples you can run immediately
- Small practice challenges to reinforce learning

The style is **conversational and friendly**, with minimal jargon — so you can focus on understanding, not memorizing.
